## üéØ When to Use Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern should be used when:
- You need to **construct complex objects step by step**
- You want to **create different representations** of the same object
- The **construction process is complex** and should be separated from the object representation
- You need **optional parameters** in object construction
- You want to **avoid telescoping constructors** (constructors with many parameters)
- The **order of construction steps matters** but can vary

## üèóÔ∏è Structure vs. Example Implementations

### Structure Implementation (`Structure/`)
```java
// Builder interface defines construction steps
public interface Builder {
    Builder buildPart1(String value);
    Builder buildPart2(String value);
    Builder buildPart3(String value);
    FinalObject getResult();
}

// Fluent interface usage
Builder builder = new ConcreteBuilder1();
FinalObject result = builder
    .buildPart1("value1")
    .buildPart2("value2")
    .buildPart3("value3")
    .getResult();
```

**Key Components:**
- **Product (FinalObject)**: Complex object being constructed
- **Builder Interface**: Defines construction steps and fluent interface
- **Concrete Builders**: Implement specific construction logic
- **Method Chaining**: Returns builder instance for fluent interface

### Real-World Example (`Example/`)
```java
// Market building with different stalls
MarketBuiler builder = new MarketContractor1();
Market market = builder
    .buildFishStall(2)
    .buildChickenStall(3)
    .buildCookieStall(1)
    .getResult();

// Using Director for predefined construction patterns
MarketDirector director = new MarketDirector();
director.buildNormalMarket(builder); // Predefined recipe
```

**Real-World Benefits:**
- **Flexible Construction**: Build markets with different combinations of stalls
- **Predefined Recipes**: Director provides common construction patterns
- **Readable Code**: Fluent interface makes construction intentions clear
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new stall types or construction patterns

## üé≠ Builder vs. Director Pattern

### Builder Only (Direct Construction)
```java
// Client controls the construction process
MarketBuiler builder = new MarketContractor1();
builder.buildFishStall(2).buildChickenStall(3);
Market market = builder.getResult();
```

**Pros:**
- **Full control** over construction process
- **Flexible** - can create any combination
- **Simple** - no additional classes needed

**Cons:**
- **Client responsibility** - client must know construction details
- **Code duplication** - same construction logic repeated
- **Complex client code** - construction logic scattered

### Builder + Director (Guided Construction)
```java
// Director encapsulates complex construction logic
MarketDirector director = new MarketDirector();
MarketBuiler builder = new MarketContractor1();
director.buildBigMarket(builder); // Predefined construction
Market market = builder.getResult();
```

**Pros:**
- **Encapsulated complexity** - construction logic in director
- **Reusable patterns** - predefined construction recipes
- **Consistent results** - same construction process every time
- **Simplified client** - client just chooses the pattern

**Cons:**
- **Additional complexity** - more classes to maintain
- **Less flexibility** - limited to predefined patterns
- **Indirection** - one more layer between client and builder

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Demo structure implementations:
   ```bash
   cd Creational/Builder/Java/Structure
   # Uncomment the Main.java code first
   javac *.java
   java Main
   ```

2. Demo real-world market building example:
   ```bash
   cd Creational/Builder/Java/Example
   javac *.java
   java Main
   ```

## üìä Expected Output (Example/Main)
```
3
1
```

The output shows:
- First line: Chicken stall size (3) from direct builder usage
- Second line: Chicken stall size (1) from director's normal market recipe

## üéì Key Learning Points

1. **Fluent Interface**: Method chaining creates readable, flowing construction code
2. **Step-by-Step Construction**: Objects built incrementally, part by part
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Construction logic separated from object representation
4. **Director Pattern**: Encapsulates complex construction algorithms
5. **Immutable Results**: Built objects can be immutable once construction is complete
6. **Flexible Construction**: Same builder can create different object configurations

## üîç Pattern Benefits

### Advantages:
- **Readable Code**: Fluent interface makes construction intentions clear
- **Flexible Construction**: Create different representations using same construction process
- **Parameter Control**: Handle optional parameters elegantly without telescoping constructors
- **Immutable Objects**: Can create immutable objects after construction
- **Reusable Logic**: Director patterns can be reused across different contexts
- **Testable**: Easy to test individual construction steps

### Considerations:
- **Increased Complexity**: More classes and interfaces to maintain
- **Memory Overhead**: Builder objects consume additional memory during construction
- **Not Always Necessary**: Simple objects don't benefit from this pattern
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand fluent interface concept

## üí° Real-World Use Cases

- **Configuration Objects**: Building complex configuration with many optional parameters
- **SQL Query Builders**: Constructing complex SQL queries step by step
- **Document Builders**: Creating documents with different sections and formatting
- **Game Character Creation**: Building characters with different attributes and equipment
- **House/Building Construction**: Architectural design with different rooms and features
- **HTTP Request Builders**: Constructing HTTP requests with headers, parameters, body
- **Test Data Builders**: Creating test objects with specific configurations

## üîß Best Practices

### Builder Design:
- **Return Builder**: Each build method should return the builder instance for chaining
- **Validation**: Validate required components before returning final object
- **Immutable Products**: Consider making the final product immutable
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive method names that indicate what's being built
- **Consistent Interface**: Keep the building interface consistent across all builders

### Director Usage:
- **Common Patterns**: Use directors for frequently used construction patterns
- **Parameterized Directors**: Allow directors to accept parameters for variation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each director method should build one specific variant
- **Documentation**: Clearly document what each director method creates

### Implementation Tips:
- **Copy Constructors**: Consider providing copy constructors for existing objects
- **Builder Reset**: Provide reset methods to reuse builder instances
- **Thread Safety**: Consider thread safety if builders will be used concurrently
- **Performance**: For performance-critical code, consider object pooling for builders

## üö¶ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Mandatory vs Optional**: Don't make all parameters optional - some should be mandatory
- **Partial Objects**: Ensure built objects are in valid state before returning
- **Builder Reuse**: Be careful when reusing builder instances - they maintain state
- **Over-Engineering**: Don't use Builder for simple objects with few parameters
- **Missing Validation**: Always validate that required components are present
- **Mutable Products**: Consider the implications of allowing post-construction modifications

## üéØ Builder vs Other Patterns

### Builder vs Factory Method:
- **Builder**: Step-by-step construction, fluent interface, complex objects
- **Factory Method**: Single-step creation, simple interface, product families

### Builder vs Abstract Factory:
- **Builder**: Focuses on how objects are constructed step by step
- **Abstract Factory**: Focuses on creating families of related objects

### Builder vs Prototype:
- **Builder**: Constructs objects from scratch using specified steps
- **Prototype**: Creates objects by cloning existing instances
