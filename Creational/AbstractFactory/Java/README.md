# Abstract Factory Design Pattern - Java Implementation

## üéØ When to Use Abstract Factory

The Abstract Factory pattern should be used when:
- You need to create **families of related products** without specifying their concrete classes
- Your system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented
- You want to provide a class library of products, revealing only their interfaces
- You need to ensure that products from the same family are used together

## üèóÔ∏è Pattern Components

### Core Structure
- **AbstractFactory**: Interface declaring methods for creating abstract products
- **ConcreteFactory**: Implements creation methods for specific product families
- **AbstractProduct**: Interface for each type of product
- **ConcreteProduct**: Specific implementations of products for each family
- **Client**: Uses only AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct interfaces

### UI Toolkit Example
- **UIFactory**: Abstract factory for creating UI components
- **WinFactory/MacFactory**: Platform-specific factories creating Windows/Mac styled components
- **Button/Checkbox**: Abstract UI component interfaces
- **WinButton/MacButton, WinCheckbox/MacCheckbox**: Platform-specific implementations
- **Application**: Client that creates and uses UI components through the factory

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Demo structure implementations only:
   ```bash
   cd Creational/AbstractFactory/Java/Structure
   javac *.java
   java Main
   ```

2. Demo example with UI toolkit:
   ```bash
   cd Creational/AbstractFactory/Java/Example
   javac *.java
   java Main
   ```

## üìä Expected Output (Structure/Main)
```
=== Structure Demo: Abstract Factory Pattern ===

1. Using ConcreteFactory1:
Client: Creating products using ConcreteFactory1
ConcreteProductA1: Operation A executed
ConcreteProductB1: Operation B executed
ConcreteProductB1: Collaborating with ConcreteProductA1

2. Using ConcreteFactory2:
Client: Creating products using ConcreteFactory2
ConcreteProductA2: Operation A executed
ConcreteProductB2: Operation B executed
ConcreteProductB2: Collaborating with ConcreteProductA2

=== Structure Demo Complete ===
```

## üìä Expected Output (Example/Main)
```
=== Example Demo: UI Toolkit Abstract Factory ===

1. Creating Windows Application:
Application: Rendering UI using WinFactory
Rendering Windows-style button [Submit]
Rendering Windows-style checkbox [ ] Remember me

Application: Simulating user interaction...
Windows button clicked with Windows event handling
Windows checkbox toggled to: checked
Checkbox state: checked

2. Creating Mac Application:
Application: Rendering UI using MacFactory
Rendering Mac-style button (Submit)
Rendering Mac-style checkbox ( ) Remember me

Application: Simulating user interaction...
Mac button clicked with Cocoa event handling
Mac checkbox toggled to: checked
Checkbox state: checked

=== Example Demo Complete ===
```

## üéì Key Learning Points

1. **Family Creation**: Each factory creates a complete family of compatible products
2. **Consistent Products**: Products from the same factory are designed to work together
3. **Easy Switching**: Changing the factory switches the entire product family
4. **Isolation**: Client code doesn't depend on concrete product classes
5. **Extensibility**: Adding new product families requires only new factory and product classes

## üîç Advantages

- **Isolation of concrete classes**: Client code uses products through abstract interfaces
- **Easy product family switching**: Change factory to get different product family
- **Consistency among products**: Products from one factory are designed to work together
- **Support for new families**: Adding new product families is relatively easy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: More classes and interfaces to maintain
- **Difficult to add new products**: Adding new product types requires changing all factory interfaces
- **Runtime overhead**: Extra level of indirection through factory interface

## üí° Real-World Use Cases

- **Cross-platform UI frameworks** (Swing, Qt, GTK)
- **Database drivers** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle drivers)
- **Game engines** (different renderers for DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan)
- **Operating system abstraction layers**
- **Document creation libraries** (PDF, Word, Excel generators)
