# Design Patterns Samples

This repository contains sample source code implementations of various **design patterns**.  
The purpose is to provide a clean and practical reference for developers who want to understand how design patterns can be applied in real projects.

> All examples are organized by **categories** → **design patterns** → **programming languages**.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Navigate to the pattern folder you want to study.  
2. Choose the programming language (e.g., `Java`, `Php`).  
3. Open the source code files.  
4. Compile and run them locally.

Examples:

**Java:**
```bash
# Structure demo (basic implementations)
cd Creational/Singleton/Java/Structure
javac *.java
java Main

# Example demo (real-world example)
cd ../Example
javac ../Structure/*.java *.java
java Main
```

**PHP:**
```bash
# Structure demo (basic implementations)
cd Creational/Singleton/Php/Structure
php Main.php

# Example demo (real-world example)
cd ../Example
php Main.php
```
