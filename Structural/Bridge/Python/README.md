## üéØ When to Use Bridge Pattern

The Bridge pattern should be used when:

- You want to **separate an abstraction from its implementation** so that both can vary independently
- You want to **avoid a permanent binding** between an abstraction and its implementation
- You want to **share an implementation** among multiple objects
- You want to **extend both abstractions and implementations** independently
- You need to **switch implementations at runtime**

## üèóÔ∏è Pattern Structure

The Bridge pattern involves these key components:

### 1. **Implementor** (Interface)
- Defines the interface for implementation classes
- Contains primitive operations that concrete implementations will provide

### 2. **Concrete Implementors**
- Provide specific implementations of the Implementor interface
- Each can have completely different implementations

### 3. **Abstraction**
- Defines the abstraction's interface
- Maintains a reference to an Implementor object
- Delegates work to the Implementor

### 4. **Refined Abstraction**
- Extends the abstraction without changing the implementor
- Provides additional functionality

## üîÑ How the Bridge Works

```
Abstraction ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Implementor
     ‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ
     ‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ
     ‚ñº                    ‚ñº
RefinedAbstraction   ConcreteImplementorA
                     ConcreteImplementorB
```

1. **Abstraction** holds a reference to **Implementor**
2. **Abstraction** delegates operations to **Implementor**
3. **Concrete Implementors** provide platform-specific implementations
4. **Refined Abstractions** can extend functionality without changing implementations

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Structure Demo (Basic Pattern Implementation)
```bash
cd Structural/Bridge/Python/Structure
python Main.py
```

### 2. Example Demo (Real-World Drawing Application)
```bash
cd Structural/Bridge/Python/Example
python Main.py
```

Drawing Application: Shapes with Different Rendering APIs

1. Creating shapes with OpenGL API:
----------------------------------------
Created: Circle at (10, 20) with radius 5
Created: Rectangle at (0, 0) with size 10x8

Drawing with OpenGL:
Circle: OpenGL: Drawing circle at (10, 20) with radius 5 using GPU acceleration
Rectangle: OpenGL: Drawing rectangle at (0, 0) with size 10x8 using GPU acceleration

2. Creating shapes with DirectX API:
----------------------------------------
Created: Circle at (15, 25) with radius 7
Created: Rectangle at (5, 5) with size 12x10

Drawing with DirectX:
Circle: DirectX: Drawing circle at (15, 25) with radius 7 using hardware acceleration
Rectangle: DirectX: Drawing rectangle at (5, 5) with size 12x10 using hardware acceleration

3. Demonstrating shape operations:
----------------------------------------
Resizing shapes:
Circle: Resized radius from 5 to 10.0 (factor: 2.0)
Rectangle: Resized from 12x10 to 18.0x15.0 (factor: 1.5)

Redrawing resized shapes:
Circle: OpenGL: Drawing circle at (10, 20) with radius 10.0 using GPU acceleration
Rectangle: DirectX: Drawing rectangle at (5, 5) with size 18.0x15.0 using hardware acceleration

4. Switching APIs dynamically:
----------------------------------------
Same circle shape, different rendering APIs:
OpenGL version:
Circle: OpenGL: Drawing circle at (0, 0) with radius 3 using GPU acceleration

DirectX version:
Circle: DirectX: Drawing circle at (0, 0) with radius 3 using hardware acceleration

## üéì Key Learning Points

### Structure Demo:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Abstraction and Implementation are completely separate
2. **Runtime Binding**: The same abstraction can work with different implementations
3. **Extensibility**: RefinedAbstraction extends functionality without changing implementations
4. **Independence**: Abstractions and implementations can evolve independently

### Example Demo:
1. **Platform Independence**: Shapes can be drawn using different graphics APIs
2. **Runtime Switching**: The same shape can use different rendering backends
3. **Extensibility**: New shapes and new APIs can be added independently
4. **Real-World Application**: Demonstrates how Bridge pattern solves actual software problems

## üîç Benefits of Bridge Pattern

- **Decoupling**: Separates abstraction from implementation
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new abstractions and implementations
- **Runtime Flexibility**: Can switch implementations at runtime
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification

## üö´ Common Pitfalls

- **Over-engineering**: Don't use Bridge for simple cases where inheritance would suffice
- **Tight Coupling**: Avoid making abstractions too dependent on specific implementations
- **Complexity**: The pattern adds complexity, so use it when the benefits justify it

## üîÑ Bridge vs Other Patterns

- **Bridge vs Adapter**: Bridge is used at design time to separate concerns, Adapter is used to make incompatible interfaces work together
- **Bridge vs Strategy**: Bridge separates abstraction from implementation, Strategy encapsulates algorithms
- **Bridge vs State**: Bridge is structural (static), State is behavioral (dynamic state changes)

## üéØ Real-World Use Cases

- **Graphics Libraries**: Different rendering backends (OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan)
- **Database Drivers**: Different database implementations (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- **Operating Systems**: Platform-specific implementations (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- **Communication Protocols**: Different transport mechanisms (TCP, UDP, WebSocket)
- **File Systems**: Different storage backends (local, network, cloud)
